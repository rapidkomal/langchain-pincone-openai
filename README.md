### LangChain : https://docs.langchain.com/docs/
LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model via an api, but will also:

1. Be data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data
2. Be agentic: Allow a language model to interact with its environment

### pincone : https://app.pinecone.io/
Pinecone is a scalable vector database for machine learning. It allows users to index and search large sets of high-dimensional vectors (such as embeddings) in real-time. Pinecone is designed to be fast, efficient, and easy to use, with APIs available for popular programming languages like Python, Java, and Go.

### Installation
